Insert the following into a file called x5.mk in /vendor/aokp/products before building:

# Check for target product
ifeq (pac_x5,$(TARGET_PRODUCT))

# Copy bootanimation
PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += \
    vendor/pac/prebuilt/540x960/bootanimation.zip:system/media/bootanimation.zip

# include PAC common configuration
include vendor/pac/config/pac_common.mk

# Inherit CM device configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/lge/x5/cm.mk)

PRODUCT_NAME := pac_x5

endif

Also, I had to comment out line 591 in packages/apps/Settings/src/com/android/settings/cyanogenmod/ButtonSettings.java to get it to build.
